<h2 class="aboutUs">About Us</h2>

    <p class="aboutUs">We at Sarasota Violins aim to provide our customers with the best quality string instruments at the best possible prices. 
        The instruments of the violin family are our passion, and we work hard so our customers may have access to excellent violins, 
        violas, cellos, and basses. We carry the finest instruments for the professional, as well as more affordable instruments for 
        the aspiring young musician. We also carry a full line of strings and accessories.</p>

    <p class="aboutUs">Our service to the string player does not end after a sale. We stand behind the instrument purchased from us and will take 
        it back towards an upgrade in the future. This makes it easy for the advancing young musician who outgrows an instrument, 
        as well as for the professional who wishes to upgrade to one of our finer instruments. All this is possible because we know 
        our instruments well and choose them carefully for quality and value.</p>
        
    <p class="aboutUs">If you are in the market for a string instrument, whether you wish to rent or purchase, please contact us and we will be happy 
        to help make the process as easy as possible.</p>
